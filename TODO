* Support for batch transform jobs

* Generate ssh keys per each user, to avoid race conditions with multiple users starting jobs at the same time

* Add tests for basic estimators (now only framework estimators are supported)

* Replace asserts to exceptions in wrapper (asserts will be removed when compiling to optimised byte code)

* Make it possible to override local credentials from env variables

* Move SageMaker Studio environment configuration to lifecycle config
  (save config on EFS or Secrets Manager)

* Turn off verbose logging to stderr not to confuse with errors (mainly for IDE notebook).

* Make switching instances in SageMaker Studio and PyCharm more smooth (list all available instances,
  put/get configuration with SSM instead of manual copy).

* Re-upload code to the remote instance with API for submitting training jobs from SageMaker Studio

* New scenario - run Jupyter inside training job for debugging (similar to SageMaker Studio container).

* New scenario - integrate local Jupyter with remote kernel gateway in SageMaker Studio
